            <h4><b> BLACK SHEEP </b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Watercolor + Ink<br><u>Description:</u> Life can feel like a reptitive, monotonous cycle. Escaping from the bustling movement of the world
            and breaking the rhythm can enable free expression of oneself. Within the piece, there are some people seen breaking the chain of movement, however, they seem to be living a more fun life.</p>

            <h4><b> STATUE</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Scratchboard + X-Acto Knife<br><u>Description:</u> This piece was an experimental assignment from high school. It was my first ever time using 
            scratchboard as a medium. The X-Acto knife was used to carve out lines, both horizontal and vertical, onto the board. Line weight and depth was created by altering
            the thickness of the line made.</thead></p>

            <h4><b>PEACE</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Watercolor + Ink<br><u>Description:</u> This piece depicts people within a community doing small, simple tasks like bike riding, hanging with friends, or just simply
            enjoying the peaceful nature and doing the small things that people tend to take for granted. It is the simple things in life that can make it worth living and these may be forgotten when
            the majority of those in society are just trying to get by in this busy world. Having peace is all about finding the balance within a life we are supposed to live versus a life we want to live. </p>

            <h4><b> INNER CHILD</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Watercolor + Ink<br><u>Description:</u> Embracing the peace and finding enjoyment from the small things like children typically do can be felt at any age. The grandma in this piece 
            is surrounded by stuffed animals while finding pleasure from these toys, typically how children would feel. Kids find interest in the small things and do not need to be concerned with the stressors of the world, so 
            embracing one's "inner child" and detaching from the common expectations of society can be healthy and fun.</p>

            <img src="images/apHallway.png" alt = "AP Hallway" style = "width:100%">
            <h4><b> STATIC</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Watercolor + Ink<br><u>Description:</u> The singer Steve Lacy wrote a song called <i>Static</i> that blew up on TikTok as a trend where students are moving around a hallway while one stands in the middle 
            looking straight at the camera. It is sort of like them breaking the 4th wall. This piece was inspired by that trend because it represents the irregularity of pausing in a society that is constantly moving. Everyone has their own schedules
            and backstories, but it is hard to pause from such a fast-paced world and see the movement around us. This is why the focal subject of this piece breaks that rhythm and remains stationary while those around them are constantly in motion.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
        <div class = "card">
            <img src="images/apPurpleYellow.png" alt = "AP Purple Yellow" style = "width:100%">
            <h4><b> MINDLESS</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Watercolor + Ink<br><u>Description:</u> The person in this piece is mindlessly doing the tedious tasks of life such as brushing her hair, doing her homework, writing down things, etcetera. Days go by with the same routine 
            or cycle for most people which causes the smallest tasks all start to seem monotous. We mindlessly do things without finding authenticity of living. This piece utilizes curved and irregular lines to depict the movement of the multiple arms. The purple and yellow are constrasts of each other and the vignette 
            brings the attention to the central point.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="column">
        <div class = "card">
            <img src="images/bridge.jpg" alt = "Bridge" style = "width:100%">
            <h4><b> BRIDGE</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Graphite<br><u>Description:</u> This graphite sketch was a replica of <i>Burning of Houses of Parliament</i> by William Turner. This was a fun piece to work on and it allowed me 
            to experiment with shadows and highlights. This piece was more focused on the craft of my skill and application techniques. </p>
        </div> 
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <div class = "card">
            <img src="images/apScreamingGirl.png" alt = "AP Screaming Girl" style = "width:100%">
            <h4><b> MOVEMENT</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Watercolor + Ink<br><u>Description:</u> This piece depicts a girl in distress. While she is surrounded by others, she still feels alone and goes through her own life feeling 
            numb and burnt out. The light brush strokes and ambiguous edges from the surrounding people represent movement and motion. The girl is lined with ink which draws the emphasis onto her.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <div class = "card">
            <img src="images/graphiteHut.jpg" alt = "Graphite Hut" style = "width:100%">
            <h4><b> HUT </b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Graphtie<br><u>Description: </u> This piece is a replica of <i>Duchess of Bedfrod's Hut, Glenfeshie</i> by Sir Edwin Landseer. This piece allowed me to practice my shading abilities and improve
            upon having contrast in values. The shadows are darkened with highlights being brought brighter with an eraser. The messiness and roughness of the lines make this piece a personal favorite because it has sketch-like qualities. </p>
        </div> 
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <div class = "card">
            <img src="images/apTrain.png" alt = "AP Train" style = "width:100%">
            <h4><b> LOOP</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Watercolor + Ink<br><u>Description:</u> This piece was inspired by an illusion piece my teacher had showed me. I was inspired by the subways and trains, all common ways people commute to work, for this piece. To me, that 
            is a clear symbol of movement and a big reprsentator of the fast-paced society we live in. Everyone depicted in this piece is walking the same path with no emotion. It also seems robotic and unhuman, which was the vibe I was going for with this piece.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="column">
        <div class = "card">
            <img src="images/graphiteWoman.jpg" alt = "Graphite Woman" style = "width:100%">
            <h4><b> WOMAN </b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Graphite<br><u>Description:</u> This sketch is another replica piece of <i>The Annunciation</i> by Henry Ossawa Tanner. Like the other replica/recreates I had above, this piece also allowed me to practice highlights and shadows. 
            It also helped me learn about lighting and tones. The original piece has a warm source of light coming from the left side, which influenced where the shadows and highlights fell. The lighting and contrast is best seen in the folds of the cloth.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="column">
        <div class = "card">
            <img src="images/nightmare.jpg" alt = "Nightmare" style = "width:100%">
            <h4><b> NIGHTMARE </b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Oil Pastel<br><u>Description:</u><i> Nightmare</i> was a piece I worked on during one of my summers in high school that represented a vivid nightmare I had. It's hard to explain what my nightmares and dreams are like because they are very 
            graphic, but art is why I can sort of express what went on in my head. This nightmare was about an evil teacher (whom I didn't have any problems with so I don't know why she was in my nightmare) that was shooting out deadly, green laser beams. The students surrounding her at 
            the bottom had mirrors that they used to deflect this light. It was a very graphic nightmare about judgement and decisions. Maybe I should seek therapy... </p>
