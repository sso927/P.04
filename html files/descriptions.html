            <h4><b> BLACK SHEEP </b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Watercolor + Ink<br><u>Description:</u> Life can feel like a reptitive, monotonous cycle. Escaping from the bustling movement of the world
            and breaking the rhythm can enable free expression of oneself. Within the piece, there are some people seen breaking the chain of movement, however, they seem to be living a more fun life.</p>

            <h4><b> STATUE</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Scratchboard + X-Acto Knife<br><u>Description:</u> This piece was an experimental assignment from high school. It was my first ever time using 
            scratchboard as a medium. The X-Acto knife was used to carve out lines, both horizontal and vertical, onto the board. Line weight and depth was created by altering
            the thickness of the line made.</thead></p>

            <h4><b>PEACE</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Watercolor + Ink<br><u>Description:</u> This piece depicts people within a community doing small, simple tasks like bike riding, hanging with friends, or just simply
            enjoying the peaceful nature and doing the small things that people tend to take for granted. It is the simple things in life that can make it worth living and these may be forgotten when
            the majority of those in society are just trying to get by in this busy world. Having peace is all about finding the balance within a life we are supposed to live versus a life we want to live. </p>

            <h4><b> INNER CHILD</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Watercolor + Ink<br><u>Description:</u>Embracing the peace and finding enjoyment from the small things like children typically do can be felt at any age. The grandma in this piece 
            is surrounded by stuffed animals while finding pleasure from these toys, typically how children would feel. Kids find interest in the small things and do not need to be concerned with the stressors of the world, so 
            embracing one's "inner child" and detaching from the common expectations of society can be healthy and fun.</p>

            <img src="images/apHallway.png" alt = "AP Hallway" style = "width:100%">
            <h4><b> STATIC</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Watercolor + Ink<br><u>Description</u>The singer Steve Lacy wrote a song called <i>Static</i> that blew up on TikTok as a trend where students are moving around a hallway while one stands in the middle 
            looking straight at the camera. It is sort of like them breaking the 4th wall. This piece was inspired by that trend because it represents the irregularity of pausing in a society that is constantly moving. Everyone has their own schedules
            and backstories, but it is hard to pause from such a fast-paced world and see the movement around us. This is why the focal subject of this piece breaks that rhythm and remains stationary while those around her are constantly in motion.</p>

    <div class="column">
        <div class = "card">
            <img src="images/apPurpleYellow.png" alt = "AP Purple Yellow" style = "width:100%">
            <h4><b> MINDLESS</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Watercolor + Ink<br><u>Description:</u> The person in this piece is mindlessly doing the tedious tasks of life such as brushing her hair, doing her homework, writing down things, etcetera. Days go by with the same routine 
            or cycle for most people that the smallest tasks all start to seem monotous. We mindlessly do things without finding authenticity of living. This piece utilizes curved and irregular lines to depict the movement of the multiple arms. The purple and yellow are constrasts off each other and the vignette 
            brings the attention the central point.</p>

            <h4><b> BRIDGE</b></h4>
            <p><u>Medium:</u> Graphite<br><u>Description:</u> This graphite sketch was a replica of <i>Burning of Houses of Parliament</i> by William Turner. This was a fun piece to work on and it allowed me 
            to experiment with shadows and highlights. This piece was more focused on the craft of my skill and application techniques. </p>
